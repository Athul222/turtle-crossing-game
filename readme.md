# Turtle Crossing Game

## Objective

Just like a crossing game, we have created a simple crossing game using python turtle module, in which you have to cross from one side to another side without hitting any of the incomming cars using your up-ward arrow key in your keyboard. The speed of the car[box] is increased every time the score increases.

## Approach

1. **Installation and Setup:**

- The script requires turtle module to be installed. The `pip` command is used to install necessary libraries

## Setup

1. **Install Python:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install PythonTurtle
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
   - Execute the Python script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
     If you're using Python 3, use `python3` instead:
     ```bash
     python3 main.py
     ```

2. **View the Output:**
   - The script will run and display the turtle `GUI`[Graphical User Interface] the results in the terminal.
